===========================================
This is a Django based application to be used to keep track
of GeoNode Instance's registry. It will support both post and get requests to different GeoNode instances.
This will be helpful in the event one has to
maintain several GeoNode instances and their is need of a quick dashboard to get status on the different instances.
 The issues to look at here include:
     *The GeoNode Version installed:
     *The Number of Maps:
     *The Number of Layers:
     *Broken Layers:
     *Broken Maps:
     *Last Backup on the GeoNode
===============================================

add to the django installed settings 'registry',
and run syncdb

Also ensure you have edited the main urls.py file to have the following

(r'^registry/',include('registry.urls')),
